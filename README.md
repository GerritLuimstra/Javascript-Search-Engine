# Javascript-Search-Engine
What am I?
Hi! I am JSE, also known as Joseph, and basically, I am a javascript driven search engine that searches through all files in the root directory of a website.
How I do it? Simple, I load the names of all files from the root directory into an object. I then scan through this object using AJAX until I find a piece of text that matches the string that has been put into for example a textfield.
Because I operate like this, there is no need for a database and because of that, I am being a solution to the "smaller" websites that do not initially require a database.
